            <h1>中国节日 Chinese Festivals</h1>
            <p>Chinese festivals hold immense cultural, social, and historical significance in China. They are highly related to the country's traditions and display its values, history, and way of life. Festivals conserve and transfer traditional customs, rituals, and folklore from one generation to the next. Many festivals are linked to ancient beliefs, legends, and myths, reflecting the values and spiritual practices of different historical periods.</p>
            <p>Festivals are also times of joy and festivity, where people come together to celebrate life's blessings, achievements, and milestones. They provide an opportunity for relaxation, enjoyment, and communal celebration. Festivals like Chinese New Year  are crucial for family reunions. Many people travel long distances to be with their loved ones, reinforcing family ties and maintaining strong familial connections.</p>

            <p>Chinese New Year, annual 15-day festival in China and Chinese communities around the world that begins with the new moon that occurs sometime between January 21 and February 20 according to Western calendars. Festivities last until the following full moon.</p>
            <p>Chinese New Year is one of the most important holidays in Chinese culture. It has influenced similar celebrations in other cultures, commonly referred to collectively as Lunar New Year, such as the Losar of Tibet, the Tết of Vietnam, the Korean New Year, and the Ryukyu New Year. It is also celebrated worldwide in regions and countries that house significant Overseas Chinese or Sinophone populations, especially in Southeast Asia. These include Singapore, Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. It is also prominent beyond Asia, especially in Australia, Canada, France, Mauritius, New Zealand, Peru, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States, as well as in many European countries.</p>

            <p>The origins of the Chinese New Year are steeped in legend. One legend is that thousands of years ago a monster named Nian (“Year”) would attack villagers at the beginning of each new year. The monster was afraid of loud noises, bright lights, and the colour red, so those things were used to chase the beast away. Celebrations to usher out the old year and bring forth the luck and prosperity of the new one, therefore, often include firecrackers, fireworks, and red clothes and decorations. Young people are given money in colourful red envelopes. In addition, Chinese New Year is a time to feast and to visit family members. Many traditions of the season honour relatives who have died.</p>

                <img src="Festivals/nn.png" loading="lazy" title="Nian">
            </div>
            <p>The Chinese New Year is associated with several myths and customs. The festival was traditionally a time to honour deities as well as ancestors.Within China, regional customs and traditions concerning the celebration of the New Year vary widely, and the evening preceding the New Year's Day is frequently regarded as an occasion for Chinese families to gather for the annual reunion dinner. It is also a tradition for every family to thoroughly clean their house, in order to sweep away any ill fortune and to make way for incoming good luck. Another practised custom is the decoration of windows and doors with red paper-cuts and couplets. Popular themes among these paper-cuts and couplets include good fortune or happiness, wealth, and longevity. Other activities include lighting firecrackers and giving money in red envelopes.</p>

                <img src="Festivals/nnn.png" loading="lazy" title="Chinese Red Envelopes" id="env">
            </div>
            <p>Chinese New Year is one of the largest celebrations in the world and with that comes lots of red envelopes. To celebrate the New Lunar Year in Chinese culture, it is tradition to gift bright red envelopes to family and friends. The envelopes are filled with money and symbolise good luck, prosperity and good wishes for the year ahead. Chinese red envelopes are generally rectangular in shape as this is to represent a shield that symbolises protection.</p>

            <h2>元宵節 Lantern Festival</h2>
            <div class="fl">
                <img src="Festivals/lf.png" loading="lazy">
            </div>
            <p>Lantern Festival, holiday celebrated in China and other Asian countries that honours deceased ancestors on the 15th day of the first month (Yuan) of the lunar calendar. The Lantern Festival aims to promote reconciliation, peace, and forgiveness. The holiday marks the first full moon of the new lunar year and the end of the Chinese New Year (see Lunar New Year). During the festival, houses are festooned with colourful lanterns, often with riddles written on them; if the riddle is answered correctly, the solver earns a small gift. Festival celebrations also include lion and dragon dances, parades, and fireworks. Small glutinous rice balls filled with fruits and nuts, called yuanxiao or tangyuan, are eaten during the festival. The round shape of the balls symbolizes wholeness and unity within the family.</p>
            <div class="fr">
                <img src="Festivals/lf1.png" loading="lazy">
            </div>
            <p>During the Lantern Festival, children go out at night carrying paper lanterns and solve riddles on the lanterns. In ancient times, the lanterns were fairly simple, and only the emperor and noblemen had large ornate lanterns. In modern times, lanterns have been embellished with many complex designs. For example, lanterns are now often made in the shape of animals. The lanterns can symbolize the people letting go of their past selves and getting new ones, which they will let go of the next year. The lanterns are almost always red to symbolize good fortune.</p>
            
            <p>The Lantern Festival may originate as far back as the Han dynasty (206 BCE to 220 CE), when Buddhist monks would light lanterns on the 15th day of the lunar year in honour of the Buddha. The rite was later adopted by the general population and spread throughout China and other parts of Asia. A legend concerning the festival’s origin tells the tale of the Jade Emperor (You Di), who became angered at a town for killing his goose. He planned to destroy the town with fire, but he was thwarted by a fairy who advised the people to light lanterns across the town on the appointed day of destruction. The emperor, fooled by all the light, assumed the town was already engulfed in flames. The town was spared, and in gratitude the people continued to commemorate the event annually by carrying colourful lanterns throughout the town.</p>
           
            <p>In the early days, young people were chaperoned in the streets in hopes of finding love. Matchmakers acted busily in hopes of pairing couples. The brightest lanterns were symbolic of good luck and hope. As time has passed, the festival no longer has such implications in most of Mainland China, Taiwan, or Hong Kong.</p>

            <h2>端午节 Dragon Boat Festival</h2>
            <p>Dragon Boat Festival is a traditional Chinese holiday that occurs on the fifth day of the fifth month of the Chinese calendar, which corresponds to late May or early June in the Gregorian calendar. The holiday commemorates Qu Yuan who was the beloved poet and prime minister of the southern Chinese state of Chu during the Warring States period, about 600 B.C. to 200 B.C., and is celebrated by holding dragon boat races and eating sticky rice dumplings called zongzi, which were southern Chinese traditions. Dragon Boat Festival integrates praying for good luck and taking respite from the summer heat.
             In September 2009, UNESCO officially approved the holiday's inclusion in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, becoming the first Chinese holiday to be selected.</p>
            <div class="fl">
                <img src="Festivals/db1.png" loading="lazy">
            </div>
            <p>The most popular legend, which establishes the origin of both the festival’s boats and dumplings, links the festival to the death of patriotic poet Qu Yuan (c. 339–278 BCE). He lived during the Warring States period and was a trusted counselor to the king of Chu, but he was later accused of treason and exiled. In despair over his banishment, Qu Yuan wandered southern Chu, writing poetry and observing the shamanistic folk rites and legends that greatly influenced his works. When he heard that Chu’s capital had been conquered, he was so distraught that he drowned himself in the Miluo River on the fifth day of the fifth month. In honor of this great poet, the holiday is sometimes called Poet’s Day. In some quarters of the tradition it is said that for years after his death devotees threw food into the river as offerings to the great Qu Yuan’s spirit, but a water dragon got to it first, so Qu Yuan came back from the dead to suggest they wrap the food in leaves, thereby creating the festival’s signature sticky rice dumplings (zongzi). </p>
            <div class="fr">
                <img src="Festivals/qy.png" title="Qu Yuan" loading="lazy">
            </div>
            <p>In other quarters it is said that people searched for his body in their boats in an attempt to save him, and, unable to locate him, they tossed zongzi into the river to distract fish from eating his body. Evidence of dragon boat racing in honor of Qu Yuan can be dated to the 5th or 6th century CE. The Hubei and Hunan provinces in particular celebrate the memory of Qu Yuan at the annual Dragon Boat Festival.</p>
           
            <p>Another legend extends the festival’s origins earlier to the Spring and Autumn period and the death of statesman Wu Zixu in 484 BCE. His father and brother were killed by the king of Chu, which led him to seek refuge in the Wu kingdom, where he was eventually betrayed and forced to kill himself. His body was tossed in the Qiantang River on the fifth day of the fifth month. His fury is said to have created such raging tides that people in some parts of China worship him as a river god. This legend is told in Fujian, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces.</p>

            <h2>中秋节 Mid-Autumn Festival</h2>
            <p>The Mid-Autumn Festival, also known as the Moon Festival or Mooncake Festival is a harvest festival celebrated in Chinese culture. On this day, the Chinese believe that the moon is at its brightest and fullest size, coinciding with harvest time in the middle of autumn. The Mid-Autumn Festival is one of the most important holidays in Chinese culture; its popularity is on par with that of Chinese New Year. The history of the festival dates back over 3,000 years. During the festival, lanterns of all size and shapes – which symbolize beacons that light people's path to prosperity and good fortune – are carried and displayed. The Mid-Autumn Festival is based on the legend of Chang'e, the Moon goddess in Chinese mythology.</p>
            <div class="fl">
                <img src="Festivals/Midautumn.png" loading="lazy">
            </div>
             <p>
                The festival celebrates three fundamental concepts that are closely connected:
             </p>
             <ul>
                <li><strong>Gathering:</strong> Such as family and friends coming together, or harvesting crops for the festival. It is said that the Moon is the brightest and roundest on this day which means family reunion. Consequently, this is the main reason why the festival is thought to be important.
                </li>
               <li><strong>Giving thanks:</strong> To give thanks for the harvest, or for harmonious unions through activities like giving mooncakes to each other.
            </li>
              <li><strong>Praying:</strong> Praying for things such as babies, a spouse, beauty, longevity, or a good future.
            </li>
             </ul>
             <p>In modern times, most people have sufficient food supplies, but the Mid-Autumn Festival is still significant because the full moon during the festival is a symbol of family reunions. As the festival evolved over time, it has gained additional meanings and now includes prayers for good health and happiness.
             </p>

             </div>
            <p>The festival was a time to enjoy the successful reaping of rice and wheat with food offerings made in honor of the moon. Today, it is still an occasion for outdoor reunions among friends and relatives to eat mooncakes and watch the Moon, a symbol of harmony and unity. During a year of a solar eclipse, it is typical for governmental offices, banks, and schools to close extra days in order to enjoy the extended celestial celebration an eclipse brings. The festival is celebrated with many cultural or regional customs, among them: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Burning incense in reverence to deities including Chang'e.</li>
                <li> Performance of dragon and lion dances, which is mainly practiced in southern China.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>鬼节 Ghost Festival</h2>
            <p>The origin of the  Ghost Festival and the Ghost Month (鬼月) in China is uncertain. Cultures in Asia from India to Cambodia to Japan share similar beliefs about the month, and these traditions seem to date from before Buddha. More ancient folk religions covered the entire area.

                Some of the ancient folk religion is incorporated in Taoism, the indigenous religion of China. The gates of hell are opened on the first day of the seventh month, and hungry ghosts are released to find food or to take revenge on those who have behaved badly according to Taoist records. The Taoists chant together to free the ghosts.</p>
                <div class="fl">
                    <img src="Festivals/ghostfestival.png" loading="lazy" alt="Ghost Festival">
                </div>
                <p>
                Another story says King Yama (the king of hell) opens the gates of hell and allows a few wild ghosts to enjoy the sacrifices on the first day of the seventh lunar month. The gates are closed on the last day of that month, and the wild, hungry ghosts return to hell. Some Chinese think that the gates of heaven are also opened during this month, and they worship their ancestors from heaven too.
            
                One the first day of the month, people burn make-believe paper money outside their homes or businesses, along the sides of roads, or in fields. Sometimes, they go to temples for this task. On a trip to China during this time, you'll probably see people occupied with this activity or find the ghost money on the ground with ashes and remains. They want to give the ghosts the money they need during their special month.
                </p>
                <div class="fr">
                    <img src="Festivals/Ghost Festivall.png" loading="lazy" alt="Ghost Festival">
                </div>
                <p>
                People also light incense and may make sacrifices of food to worship the hungry unhappy ghosts. People trust that the ghosts won't do something terrible to them or curse them after eating their sacrifices and while holding their money. They put up red painted paper lanterns everywhere including business and residential areas.

                There are street ceremonies, market ceremonies, and temple ceremonies. During street and market ceremonies, people gather at the streets and markets to celebrate the festival. At temple ceremonies, monks in temples organize festive activities. Many believe it is important to appease the ghosts to avoid spiritual attack.


               On the opening day of the underworld gate, some Chinese people choose to float water lanterns to help guide the spirits on their journey, as a way to honor the deceased.
